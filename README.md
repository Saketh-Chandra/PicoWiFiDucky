# PicoWiFiDucky
PicoWiFiDucky is an open-source project inspired by the ['pico-ducky'](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) project on GitHub, and based on the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board. It leverages the Pico's built-in HID capabilities, along with WiFi and web development, to create a wireless HID device that allows for remote execution of keyboard inputs on target systems.

- With PicoWiFiDucky, users can easily create a USB rubber ducky-like device with WiFi connectivity and web-based payload delivery.

- This project is ideal for penetration testing, remote administration, and other use cases where wireless HID capabilities are essential.
